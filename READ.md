The website for InSignum. InSignum is a project to develop a wearable
sound sensor that gives vibro-tactile feedback to the wearer. The
feedback is meant to provide information abot the pitch, loudness and
pattern of sounds that occur in the proximity. The wearable is designed
for people that are hard of hearing. For the code for the POC of the
wearable see our other repo
